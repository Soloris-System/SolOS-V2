**SolOS V2** is a powerful, custom-built Discord bot designed for comprehensive server management and deep community engagement. What started as a simple moderation bot has evolved into a full-fledged "Server Operating System" with a persistent database, a modular command structure, and unique features that set it apart.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Persistent Database:** Powered by the built-in `sqlite3` library, all user XP, moderation logs, and role-bindings are saved permanently and survive bot restarts.
*   **XP & Leveling System:**
    *   Users earn XP passively by chatting.
    *   Custom, server-specific roles are automatically assigned based on XP milestones.
    *   A public `/leaderboard` command to foster competition.
    *   Full administrative control to add/remove XP and bind new roles.
*   **Advanced Anti-Abuse Protocol:**
    *   Monitors moderation actions (kicks/bans) from **both the bot's commands and manual Discord UI actions**.
    *   If a moderator exceeds the daily limit, their roles are automatically removed and the proper admin is alerted, preventing abuse of power.
*   **Modular Cog Architecture:** Commands are logically separated into cogs (`moderation`, `experience`, `fun`, etc.), making the code clean, organized, and easy to expand.
*   **Comprehensive Command Suite:** Over 35 commands covering everything from moderation and role management to user utilities and fun, troll-like commands.
*   **24/7 Replit Hosting:** Fully configured for deployment on Replit, including a keep-alive web server to ensure constant uptime.
